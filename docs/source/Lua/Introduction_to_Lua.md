## 1.1 What Lua is

**Lua** is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.  
The Lua virtual machine and interpreter are written in C.  
It contains 21 keywords, which makes the language rather small.  
The real power of Lua comes from its extensible nature.  
Programming constructs such as object-oriented programming (OOP) can be  
implemented in Lua, even though the language has no native support for objects.
